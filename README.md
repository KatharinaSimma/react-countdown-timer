## About

This countdown timer was is a project from the awesome [Upleveled Bootcamp](https://upleveled.io/)!
I am a developer and I am queer :rainbow:. I wanted to use my new skills to make my community a tiny bit more visible and hopefully someone out there likes it. Over time I hope to add more events and flags and improve the design :purple_heart:.

And a happy queer year to you all!

- I was inspired by this article by Alvaro Montoro about how to make LGBTQI+ flags in CSS: https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68009/lgbtq-flags-coded-in-css
- This repo was helpful in assembling my timezones: https://gist.github.com/ykessler/3349960
